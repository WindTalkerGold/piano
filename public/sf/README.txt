This folder holds local General MIDI (GM) soundfont files (.sf2) for preview playback.

Note:
- Soundfonts are not checked into git (see .gitignore in this folder).
- You can download GM soundfonts from Polyphone's soundfonts catalog.
- Suggested names for quick setup:
  - piano.sf2
  - violin.sf2
  - guitar.sf2

After placing files here, the preview page will load the matching soundfont based on the piece's selected instrument.
